        <p> Having little experience with three-dimensional modeling, learning Fusion 360 was challenging at first. Trying to figure out the interface and the layout itself was a learning curve. Throughout the whole process, the hardest part for me was learning the axis and the planes as I was never sure if I was on the right one. However, after some trial and error, I created a stamp model mimicking the tutorial, as well as a stamp model of my own. The first model is a direct copy of the tutorial. This process of following exact instructions helped me learn Fusion 360. The second model is my own design. I added elements like fillets, and chamfers to enhance the base of the handle. I was inspired by stained glass patterns, and wanted to express a similar geometric surface. I also changed the parameters of the handle to have an hourglass shape. The final addition was to add my name on the plate of the stamp. I used a cursive font as I wanted it to have a vintage aesthetic to it. Overall, creating the stamp in Fusion 360 was troublesome at first, however, once I got the hang of it, a great creative output. <br><br>
